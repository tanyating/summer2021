p.3: N=3 template plot: label a couple of the pts with (t,R) values.
N=3 means only 3 pixels in the detector!

results for meth1 should say meth1.

mol -> molecule

p.9: meth2 explain better:
     1) define hat operator: given v,  v_0 := v - 1.v_m = zero-mean part of v.
                                    hatv = v_0 / ||v_0||
        "Hat" takes zero-mean part, scaled to l2-norm 1.
     2) replace name d_2 by c = cos(theta) where theta is ang btw zero-mean
        parts of the vectors.
        Ie cross-correlation c(x,y) = (x,y) / ||x|| ||y||  \in [-1,1]
        We're doing c(a_0, y_0), where v_0 means subtract the mean cmpt of v.

p.14 "Actual" molecule -> test with molecule present?
"True molecule"?
miss of -> missed

Do the scatter plot from below for mtg if poss.

move p.15 to after other ROC.

Adapt p.13 to be final slide Conclusions:
* quote only 2 digits. Condense conclusion statements into few lines.
* add concl about TP.
* knowing TP rate for different R's enables interpretation of
  detection rates in images (what fraction missed?)
* for 4x1 aspect molecule, TP ratio for meth2 is 1.6 (whatever)
* we have theory for why tall FPR < fat FPR, in expectation for random mol.

Future plans at bottom of Concl slide?

Qu's for Niko: zero-mean is useful model?
Do they throw away the mean part because don't trust it?




2 Research

2A. theory for meth1

  - check integral vs Manas.
  - check theory EFRP prediction: is for one translation test.
   compare avg over mols of experimental FPR for meth1 for a *single* (t,R).
   (otherwise we're doing in the current meth1 implementation, repeated tests
   and taking the best over all of them, not what the theory refers to!)
   Note a possible other useful variant of meth1 closer to Niko does is
   to allow a mol to be detected or not detected at *each* translation.

  - apply Laplace's method (Gaussian approx, ie upsidedown parabola
  approx for log of the integrand, read off max and the curvature at
  the max), for asymptotics in p,q, possibly sigma, for the EFPR 1D
  integral.


2B. experiments

i) are the nearly-1 TP rates in ROC on p.8 due to it finding a FP mol in
a wrong location, uncorrelated to the true (t,R).
0.6 of the time it's finding the correct t; the rest of the 0.4 of the
time it's the FPR causing a detection in some random place - check if so.

The FR rate of 1 we see now is bad (picking the max of multiple pixels
each of which has a FPR).

Eg plot scatter of true vs found t values: should be diagonal density,
plus uniform bar over the found-t axis (eg vertical).

ii) make a meth1 variant (meth1a): has threshold (interpret as a prior of being
a mol at each (t,R)). May vary by orientation. Will certainly vary by p,q,N,
sigma? 

Having multiple molecules in the field of view:
This entails new logic in the classifier tests.
sparse matrix (matlab can handle) size Ntests * Nc with entries 0 or 1.
Would allow meas of FPR per pixel (t).
Could allow taking of single local max over t values to allow variation
in translation.

meth1 takes into acct the norm ||a||_2, gets slightly higher TP rate than
meth2. WOuld be nice if meth1 preserved DC part.
(DC = direct current = zero-frequency = mean of a signal).

Niko's MATLAB nm(v) computes v_0 = v - cptwise mean, then returns
v_0 scaled to have variance = 1 per pixel, ie l2 norm of sqrt(N)
for N pixels.
Applies to the image (signal).
For each template, doesn't use nm(),
but subtracts mean, and also manually normalizes to variance 1
across the whole image.
So, their values of inner-prod will be N times bigger than ours.

Current test of FPR is using all (t,R)'s.
But really we want to measure FPR-per-translation : could be measured
by sending in noise vectors to a detector for only t=central, and all R's.
