Tanya findings:

* 8x2 has higher FP than 4x4 in meth1.
* meth2 has worse FN (10x) than meth1, but better FP (Manas).
* norm-case: fat has higher FP than tall.

Thoughts:

40x40 vs 80x20  should distinguish much better than 4x4 and 8x2

=> For small mol's need to average over perf results!

meth2 matches Rickgauer's, but we need to check w/ them -> have mtg.

always choose norm=1 (mol entries ~ unif zero mean, var=1)


Questions:

1) in expectation over mol samples, is FP rate higher for 4x4 or 8x2 (in fat or tall orientations) ?
Or, all the same?  Assume N(0,1) for mol entries.
For method1 (dist = sum of squares).   exp(-dist) doesn't matter, since method just compares dists.
Should be tractable analysis since comparing sums and squares of N(0,1) variables.
Can check by running many random mols.

2) meth1 vs meth2 (with threshold tau where FN=FP rates). Which has better performance?
Ans for 4x4 and 8x2.   Perf should be averaged over mol seeds too (or go to much larger single mol's).

3)
ROC curves: (look up wiki).
plot (for a single sigma),
performance as (FP, 1-FN=TP) in [0,1]^2. Closer to top-left, better.  (area under ROC curve ->1
is best).  Can compare various methods.
Sweep tau and plot curve, ROC = receiver operating curve.
We have different types of TP: i) correct-translation (t), any-rot
                               ii) correct (t,r)   ... do this first

Plot one ROC curve for each molecule (4x4, 8x2), and one for each sigma level (picking =1 fine
to begin with).
