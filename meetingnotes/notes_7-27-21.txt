Tanya plan:
Wed Aug 4 usual mtg, finalize things for Thurs 2-3 or 4-5 mtg w/ Niko/Pilar.

bash out some slides to explain to Niko/Pilar: explain our discrete model,
signal vecs y, a.  (make couple of pics).
2 detection methods.
ROC results for the two methods, as in 2A-C below.
PS beamer+latex for slides.



details:


1) theory for expected FP rate (expectation over both mol & noise),
for meth 1 (max-lik = LDA):

only need consider compts of y in supp of mol.

Consider p=q=2: a1 ~ a2 ~ N(0,2)
N>2 arbitrary, since only the 2 pixels in supp(a) matter.
Then EFPR = (norm consts for Gaussians) .
int_{(a,y) in D} exp(-||a||^2/4) exp(-||y||^2/2sigma^2) da dy

over domain D := {a1 y1 + a2 y2 >= ||a||^2/2}

In the p=q=1 case we had an integral of axis-aligned MV Gaussian over
double-cone region as in pencil notes.

use rot invar (in a, and also in y), to try and write as 1d integral
(worst case: use MATLAB integrate...)

Compare p*q =   2x2    vs  4x1  vs 1x4    EFPR's.   (3 1D integrals)

Continue!...  (but not a priority for Niko as much as 2A-C below).
Manas may have the integral. Don't worry too much about this.


2) ROC curves for meth2:

* fig 3,4 similar -> once gets the right t, the rotation is ok.
(sigma=1 which is same as mol)

2A)
* can make variants of ROC plots for FP rate restricted to one or other
orientation?  (2 curves on same ROC plot, color-coded by orientation).
   - Look at data - does FP rate depend on orientation?

normalizing FP? send in *all* noise, measure frac of times get detected
mol at orientation 1,3 = FP_{tall}.
 or at orientation 2,4 = FP_{fat}.
FP_tot = sum of two above. Let's plot these on Fig. 1 of discret_meth_2.m:
splitting y-extent into two components for FP.

[You can still send in half noise, half true signals, then frac of times when
sent in noise and got detected mol.] -> already doing.

2B)
plot TP rate per orientation (tall, fat) TP_{tall}
overall TP rate (as if) sent in all signal (equi over 4 rots),
frac of those that get correct (t,r).
frac of those that get correct (t) and any r.

2C) then add to the cigar-mol ROC curves:
ROC curves to plot (2 curves on same plot, one for each detection orientation):
TP_{tall} (frac correct of tall sent in) vs FP_{tall}
TP_{fat} (frac correct of fat sent in) vs FP_{fat}
want both these curves to be close to top-left of ROC curve.

Do this only for 1 random seed for now - since otherwise all washes out.
We realised that the best tau probably depends on the particular mol matrix,
so averaging the ROC over mol seeds is not representative of the experiments.

Thus try for larger, 8x8 vs 16x2, 1 random seed mol.


Will tell us whether to test...
3) meth3 = meth2 but with tau_tall, tau_fat  = 2 distinct thresholds,
chosen for that particular mol.
